        p Finding the Line will explore fear in its various guises. The film will delve into how we deal with this potentially crippling emotion in hopes of inspiring others to overcome their fears. With the mountains as their backdrop, two sisters, Anna and Nat Segal, will set out on a journey to decipher fear and its hold over us.
        p As elite skiers, Anna and Nat subject themselves to a mountain environment that forces them to deal with fear and risk on a day to day basis. Avalanches, cliffs and 100ft kickers come with the territory. Their daily exposure to risk has given them an insight into fear and how it has protected them from harm, but also how it has frustrated their progress.
        p With experience on their side, Anna and Nat are launching themselves into a twelve month adventure across the globe in search of new and challenging experiences on skis, where they will find themselves face-to-face with their fears. Will they be able to find the line between progressing in their sport and taking excessive risk?
        p This film will couple interviews with leading action sport icons (including Elyse Saugstad, Kaya Turski and more), as well as scientific experts, including psychologist Professor Barbara Meyer from the University of Wisconsin, USA and hormone expert Professor Susan Davis from Monash University. The experiences of these athletes and scientists will intertwine the science of fear with the real-life experience of personally dealing with this emotion.
